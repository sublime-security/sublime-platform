:   Introduction
: ==========================================

# This script allows you to install the latest version of the Sublime Platform by running:
#
: curl -sL https://sublimesecurity.com/install.sh | bash
#
# Note: lines prefixed with ":" are no-ops but still retain syntax highlighting. Bash considers ":" as true and true can
# take an infinite number of arguments and still return true. Inspired from the Firebase tool installer.

:   Advanced Usage
: ==========================================

# You can change the behavior of this script by passing environmental variables to the bash process. For example:
#
: curl -sL https://sublimesecurity.com/install.sh | arg1=foo arg2=bar bash
#

: -----------------------------------------
:  Sublime Host - default: localhost
: -----------------------------------------

# By default, this script assumes that Sublime is deployed locally. If you installed Sublime on a remote VPS or VM,
# you'll need to specify IP address of your remote system.
#
: curl -sL https://sublimesecurity.com/install.sh | sublime_host=0.0.0.0 bash
#
# Replace 0.0.0.0 with the IP address of your remote system.

: -----------------------------------------
:  Interactive - default: true
: -----------------------------------------

# By default, this script assumes that it is being called through the quickstart one-liner. In that case, we need to
# confirm where the Sublime instance is deployed unless it's passed in explicitly.
#
: curl -sL https://sublimesecurity.com/install.sh | interactive=false bash
#

: -----------------------------------------
:  Clone Platform - default: true
: -----------------------------------------

# By default, this script will clone the latest Sublime Platform repo and enter into it before proceeding with the rest
# of the installation. You may want to disable this if you're running this script from within the Sublime Platform repo
# already.
#
: curl -sL https://sublimesecurity.com/install.sh | clone_platform=false bash
