Sublime Platform
==========
by Sublime Security

Overview
---------
An open, adaptable email security platform for writing, running, and sharing custom detection and response rules to block phishing attacks, hunt for threats, and more.

Traditional email security is a one-size-fits-all black box. The Sublime Platform gives defenders control over their email environment and uses an intuitive, interoperable, purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL).

Setup
----------

```console
curl -sL https://sublime.security/install.sh | sh
```
