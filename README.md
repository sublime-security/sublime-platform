Sublime Platform
==========
by Sublime Security

Overview
---------
A free and open platform for detecting and preventing email attacks like BEC, malware, and credential phishing. Gain visibility and control, hunt for advanced threats, and collaborate with the community.

Sublime uses Message Query Language (MQL), a domain-specific language purpose-built for describing behavior in email. MQL is email provider agnostic, enabling defenders to write, run, and share Detections-as-Code.
