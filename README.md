Sublime Platform
==========
by Sublime Security

Overview
---------
An open, adaptable email security platform for writing, running, and sharing custom detection and response rules to block phishing attacks, hunt for threats, and more.

Why?
----------
Traditional email security is a one-size-fits-all black box.

The Sublime Platform **gives defenders control over their email environment** and uses an intuitive, interoperable, purpose-built domain-specific language (DSL).

Setup
----------

```console
curl -sL https://sublime.security/install.sh | sh
```

[View Docker Quickstart](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/docs/quickstart-docker)

Detection rules
----------
Open-source detection rules are maintained in the [sublime-rules repo](https://github.com/sublime-security/sublime-rules).
