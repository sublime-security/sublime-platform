Sublime Platform
==========
by Sublime Security

Overview
---------
An open, adaptable email security platform for writing and running custom detection and response rules to block phishing attacks, hunt for threats, and more.

Why?
----------
Modern email security is a one-size-fits-all black box. The same phishing attacks continue to land, and the same legitimate emails continue to get blocked.

The Sublime Platform **gives defenders control over their email environment** and uses an intuitive, interoperable, purpose-built [YARA-like rules language](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/docs/message-query-language) for sharing new detection rules with others.

Setup
----------

Follow the [setup instructions](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/docs/installation) to deploy using Docker, AWS, or use a Managed instance.

The following message sources are supported today:
- Microsoft 365
- Google Workspace
- IMAP
- Custom API
